			<p class="Title">Eternal marriage</p>
			<p>
				In Lesson 15 of the book “The Eternal Family Teacher Manual” we read: “The importance of marriage has been taught since the earliest day of the Church. The doctrine of eternal marriage, however, was not widely taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith until the Nauvoo era.”
			</p>
			<p>
				In the same book Parley P. Pratt of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared: “It was from [Joseph Smith] that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity. … It was from him that I learned that we might cultivate these affections and grow and increase in the same to all eternity; while the result of our endless union would be an offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, or the sands of the sea shore. … I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I loved—with a pureness—an intensity of elevated, exalted feeling.”
			</p>
			<p>
				While here on earth, a man and a woman while married by the laws of the land can have their union recognized and honored by the lands where their marriage is accepted, such recognition brings responsibilities, commitments and privileges that otherwise would not be provided to unmarried couples and their children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eternal, or Celestial marriage is when a man and a woman under the direction of a worthy holder of the authority of God presides and organizes what is called an eternal union of both spouses, and their children, to obtain and maintain all the blessings within the heavens from our Father in Heaven.
			</p>
			<p>
				The important questions that are part of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in regards of such observances are, does God exist? Does He grant authority to men on earth to preside on His name like Moses in olden times to marry a couple to not just be married until death do its part, but for all the eternities in time in Heaven? If these things are true, after such ceremony is kept and officiated by worthy members of the church within Temples, promises are granted to them to be received in this life and in the after life while with God. As mentioned within Doctrine and Covenants 132:19, “And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.”
